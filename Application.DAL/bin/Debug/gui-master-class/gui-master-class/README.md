# Greenway's Angular Master Class
This project is intended to teach Greenway developers best practices and techniques for Angular projects. This project is not all inclusive, and some content will be deferred to [Angular's own documentation][1].

We will start with the basics of Angular, such as Components, Directives, and Services, and then move on to more advanced tools such as Routing and Dynamic Instantiation. We will also use Greenway's UI library, a npm package developed and maintained by Greenway developers to help accelerate UI development.

## Labs
At the root of this project is the `/labs` folder which contains each individual lab assignment. You should attempt to complete each lab in the assigned order, as each lab builds from the previous.

This project uses git for version control, and you can view the folder from any git UI such as `git-extensions` or `sourcetree`. 

Furthermore, each lab is completed as individual commits in the tree. You can freely view, or checkout, any of the commits to see how to complete the labs. We **recommend that you attempt each lab on your own** before looking to the commits for help.

## Running the project
You must use `yarn` for this project.

To begin, run the following commands in a console:
```
yarn
yarn start
```

This will install the packages, and then start the application. You can make changes to the code and see the changes live as the page will automatically refresh.
